   			<p>Do you have cable management issues in your data center? Do you have trouble tracing cables from one piece of equipment to another? Do you have unused fiber cables running underfloor and/or overhead that are congesting pathways, blocking airflow and making a huge mess?
   				<br>
			Most of these issues are due to utilizing a point-to-point cabling infrastructure instead of an organized, structured cabling infrastructure.</p>
			<h3>Point-to-Point Cabling</h3>
			<p>A point-to-point infrastructure is when standard duplex fiber jumpers are used to directly connect equipment. This almost always leads to a cabling system that is very difficult to manage. Most data centers were built before there were any standards or guidance on this topic so many of today’s infrastructure professionals have inherited the issues that come with point-to-point cabling.</p>
			<h3>Structured Cabling</h3>
			<p>On the other hand, structured cabling is a standards-based approach that alleviates the issues above. Structured cabling systems use various product sets, like fiber optic trunks and fiber optic enclosures, to enable a static cabling infrastructure to easily adapt to the ever-changing landscape of data center hardware migrations.
			<br>r
			A well-designed structured cabling system increases uptime, optimizes scalability and maximizes return on investment while decreasing your technology footprint and minimizing operating expenses.
